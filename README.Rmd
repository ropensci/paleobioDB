`paleobioDB` is a package for downloading, visualizing and processing
data from the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of paleobioDB from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/paleobioDB")
```

## General overview

`paleobioDB` has 19 functions to wrap most endpoints of the PaleobioDB
API, plus 8 functions to visualize and process the fossil data. The
API documentation for the Paleobiology Database can be found
[here](https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/).

## Download fossil occurrences from PaleobioDB

### `pbdb_occurrences`

Here is an example of how to download all fossil occurrences that
belong to the family Canidae in the Quaternary:

```{r canidae}
library(paleobioDB)

canidae <- pbdb_occurrences(
  base_name = "canidae",
  interval = "Quaternary",
  show = c("coords", "class"),
  vocab = "pbdb",
  limit = "all"
)

dim(canidae)

head(canidae, 3)
```

Note that if the plotting and analysis functions of this package are
going to be used (as demonstrated in the sections below), it is
necessary to specify the parameter `show = c("coords", "class")` in
the `pbdb_occurrences()` function.  This returns taxonomic and
geographic information for the occurrences that is required by these
functions.

### Caution with the raw data

Beware of synonyms and errors, they could twist your estimations about
species richness, evolutionary and extinction rates, etc. `paleobioDB`
users should be critical about the raw data downloaded from the
database and filter the data before analyzing it.

For instance, when using `base_name` for downloading information with
the function `pbdb_occurrences()`, check out the synonyms and errors
that could appear in `accepted_name`, `genus`, etc. If they are not
corrected or eliminated, they will increase the richness of genera.

## Map the fossil records

### `pbdb_map`

Plots a map with the species occurrences.

```{r pbdb_map}
pbdb_map(canidae)
```

### `pbdb_map_occur`

Returns a map and a raster object with the sampling effort (number of
fossil records per cell). The user can change the resolution of the
cells.

```{r pbdb_map_occur}
pbdb_map_occur(canidae, res = 5)
```

### `pbdb_map_richness`

Returns a map and a raster object with the number of different
species, genera, family, etc. per cell. As with `pbdb_map_occur()`,
the user can change the resolution of the cells.

```{r pbdb_map_richness}
pbdb_map_richness(canidae, res = 5, rank = "species")
```

## Explore your fossil data

### `pbdb_temp_range`

Returns a dataframe and a plot with the time span of the species,
genera, families, etc. in your query.  Make sure that enough vertical
space is provided in the graphics device used to do the plotting if
there are many taxa of the specified rank in your data set.

```{r pbdb_temp_range, fig.dim = c(7, 10), out.lines = 12}
pbdb_temp_range(canidae, rank = "species")
```

### `pbdb_richness`

Returns a dataframe and a plot with the number of species (or genera,
families, etc.) across time. You should set the temporal extent and
the temporal resolution for the steps.

```{r pbdb_richness, out.lines = 12}
pbdb_richness(canidae, rank = "species", temporal_extent = c(0, 5), res = 0.5)
```

### `pbdb_orig_ext`

Returns a dataframe and a plot with the number of new appearances and
last appearances of species, genera, families, etc. in your query
across time. You should set the temporal extent and the resolution of
the steps. `orig_ext = 1` plots new appearances:

```{r pbdb_orig_ext_1, out.lines = 12}
pbdb_orig_ext(
  canidae,
  rank = "species",
  orig_ext = 1, temporal_extent = c(0, 5), res = 0.5
)
```

And `orig_ext = 2` plots last appearances in the provided dataframe
(possibly extinctions, if the data are complete enough).

```{r pbdb_orig_ext_2, out.lines = 12}
pbdb_orig_ext(
  canidae,
  rank = "species",
  orig_ext = 2, temporal_extent = c(0, 5), res = 0.5
)
```

## `pbdb_subtaxa`

Returns a plot and a dataframe with the number of species, genera,
families, etc. in your dataset.

```{r pbdb_subtaxa}
pbdb_subtaxa(canidae, do.plot = TRUE)
```

## `pbdb_temporal_resolution`

Returns a plot and a list with a summary of the temporal resolution of
the fossil records.

```{r pbdb_temporal_resolution, out.lines = 12}
pbdb_temporal_resolution(canidae)
```

## Docker

We include a Dockerfile to ease working on the package as it fulfills
all its system dependencies.

How to load the package with Docker:

1. Install Docker. Reference here: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

2. Build the docker image. From the root folder of this
   repository, type:

```bash
docker build -t rpbdb Docker
```

This command will create a docker image in your system based on some
of the [rocker/tidyverse](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse/)
images.  You can see the new image with `docker image ls`.

3. Start a container for this image. Type the following command
   picking some `<password>` of your choice.

```bash
docker run -d --name="rpbdb_rstudio" --rm -p 8787:8787 \
	   -e PASSWORD=<password> -v $PWD:/home/rstudio rpbdb
```

This will start a container with access to your current folder where
all the code of the package is.  Inside the container, the code will
be located in `/home/rstudio`. It also exposes the port 8787 of the
container so you may access the RStudio web application which is
bundled in the Rocker base image.

4. Then, you can either:

	- Navigate to `http://localhost:8787`. Enter with username
	"rstudio" and the password you used in the command above.

	- Or you can enter the container via console with:

	```bash
	docker exec -ti -u rstudio -w /home/rstudio rpbdb_rstudio R
	```

Either from RStudio or from within the container you can install the
package from source with:

```r
install.packages(".", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

5. When you are finished, you can stop the container:

```bash
docker container stop rpbdb_rstudio
```
