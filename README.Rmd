`paleobioDB` is a package for downloading, visualizing and processing
data from the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of paleobioDB from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/paleobioDB")
```

## General overview

`paleobioDB` has 19 functions to wrap most endpoints of the PaleobioDB
API, plus 8 functions to visualize and process the fossil data. The
API documentation for the Paleobiology Database can be found
[here](https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/).

## Download fossil occurrences from PaleobioDB

### `pbdb_occurrences`

Here is an example of how to download all fossil occurrences that
belong to the family Canidae in the Quaternary:

```{r canidae}
library(paleobioDB)

canidae <- pbdb_occurrences(
  base_name = "canidae",
  interval = "Quaternary",
  show = c("coords", "classext", "ident"),
  vocab = "pbdb",
  limit = "all"
)

dim(canidae)

head(canidae, 3)
```

### Caution with the raw data

Beware of synonyms and errors, they could twist your estimations about
species richness, evolutionary and extinction rates, etc. `paleobioDB`
users should be critical about the raw data downloaded from the
database and filter the data before analyzing it.

For instance, when using `base_name` for downloading information with
the function `pbdb_occurrences()`, check out the synonyms and errors
that could appear in `accepted_name`, `genus`, etc. If they are not
corrected or eliminated, they will increase the richness of genera.

## Map the fossil records

### `pbdb_map`

Plots a map with the species occurrences.

```{r pbdb_map}
pbdb_map(canidae)
```

### `pbdb_map_occur`

Returns a map and a raster object with the sampling effort (number of
fossil records per cell). The user can change the resolution of the
cells.

```{r pbdb_map_occur}
pbdb_map_occur(canidae, res = 5)
```

### `pbdb_map_richness`

Returns a map and a raster object with the number of different
species, genera, family, etc. per cell. As with `pbdb_map_occur()`,
the user can change the resolution of the cells.

```{r pbdb_map_richness}
pbdb_map_richness(canidae, res = 5, rank = "species")
```

## Explore your fossil data

### `pbdb_temporal_range`

Returns a dataframe and a plot with the time span of the species,
genera, families, etc. in your query.

```{r pbdb_temp_range, fig.dim = c(7, 10)}
tmp_range <- pbdb_temp_range(canidae, rank = "species")
head(tmp_range)
```

### `pbdb_richness`

Returns a dataframe and a plot with the number of species (or genera,
families, etc.) across time. You should set the temporal extent and
the temporal resolution for the steps.

```{r pbdb_richness}
pbdb_richness(canidae, rank = "species", temporal_extent = c(0, 10), res = 1)
```

### `pbdb_orig_ext`

Returns a dataframe and a plot with the number of new appearances and
last appearances of species, genera, families, etc. in your query
across the time. You should set the temporal extent and the resolution
of the steps. `orig_ext = 1` plots new appearances, `orig_ext = 2`
plots last appearances in the provided data (possibly extinctions, if
the data are complete enough).

```{r pbdb_orig_ext_1}
pbdb_orig_ext(
  canidae,
  rank = "species",
  orig_ext = 1, temporal_extent = c(0, 10), res = 1
)
```

```{r pbdb_orig_ext_2}
pbdb_orig_ext(
  canidae,
  rank = "species",
  orig_ext = 2, temporal_extent = c(0, 10), res = 1
)
```

## `pbdb_subtaxa`

Returns a plot and a dataframe with the number of species, genera,
families, etc. in your dataset.

```{r pbdb_subtaxa}
pbdb_subtaxa(canidae, do.plot = TRUE)
```

## `pbdb_temporal_resolution`

Returns a plot and a dataframe with a main summary of the temporal
resolution of the fossil records.

<!-- TODO: truncate output -->

```{r pbdb_temporal_resolution, results = "hide"}
pbdb_temporal_resolution(canidae)
```

## Docker [TODO]

We are including a Dockerfile to ease working on the package as it
fulfills all the system dependencies of the package.

How to load the package with Docker:

1. Install Docker. Reference here: https://docs.docker.com/get-started

2. Build the *docker image*: from the root folder of this
   repository. Type:

```bash
docker build -t rpbdb Docker
```

This command will create a *docker image* in your system based on some
of the [rocker/tidyverse](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse/)
images.  You can see the new image with ```docker image ls```.

3. Start a container for this image. Type the following command
   picking some *<password>* of your choice.

```bash
docker run -d --rm -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=<password> -v $PWD:/home/rstudio rpbdb
```

This will start a container with access to your current folder where
all the code of the package is.  Inside the container, the code will
be located in */home/rstudio*. It also exposes the port 8787 of the
container so you may access to the RStudio web application which is
bundled in the *rocker* base image.

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:8787`. Enter with user=*rstudio* and
   the password you used in the command above.

5. You may enter to the container via console with:

```bash
docker exec -ti ravis bash
```

Either from RStudio or from within the container you can install the
package out of the code with:

```bash
cd /home/rstudio
R
```

```r
library(devtools)
install.packages(".", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```
