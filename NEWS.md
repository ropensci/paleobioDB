paleobioDB 0.7.0.9000
=====================

MAJOR CHANGES

* Update to API version 1.2 (see
  [issue 57](https://github.com/ropensci/paleobioDB/issues/57))

* Update documentation to reflect parameter name changes in version
  1.2 of the API.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Use methods from package `terra` instead of `raster` in functions
  that plot and return raster objects.

* Query functions warn the user when no records are returned.

* Query functions report warnings generated by the API instead of
  silently ignoring them.

BUG FIXES

* Make names more readable in the plot produced by `pbdb_temp_range()`
  (#22).

* Prevent x-axis title from overlapping with tick labels in
  `pbdb_richness()` (#43).

* Fix bug in map plotting caused by latitude and longitude values
  being returned as strings by the API (#50).

* Fix a certificate issue in RCurl that affected Windows users (#53,
  #54).

paleobioDB 0.7.0
================

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Ensures travis fails on either API or internal tests failure

BUG FIXES

* Fix [issue 45](https://github.com/ropensci/paleobioDB/issues/45) about wrong API endpoint.
* Fix errors in several functions in `rpbdb_temporal_functions.R`


paleobioDB 0.6.0
================

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Integrates codecov
* Adds tests execution to travis. Tests are not part of the CRAN check for this
package since they rely on calling to the PaleobioDB API.
* Improves error reporting in pbdb_temp_range. [issue 28](https://github.com/ropensci/paleobioDB/issues/28)

BUG FIXES

* Fix error in pbdb_occurrences under R 3.5.


paleobioDB 0.5.0
===============

BUG FIXES

* Fix bug after JSON responses from the API started including the "elapsed_time" before the "records" element.


paleobioDB 0.4.0
===============

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* From now our functions for exploring the data of the paleobioDB use "matched_name" and "matched_number" instead of raw names and raw taxon numbers of the former versions of the package. This means that the default output of richness and first and last occurrences of species/genus/etc. changed. Before we used the original taxonomic identification of the fossil records, now we use the revised taxonomic identification of the fossil records.

BUG FIXES

* Fix duplicated records bug in pbdb_occurrences caused by API returning and array of two identical values in field "reference_no". From now on, if a filed is returned by the API as an array it will be mapped to a semicolon separated string.
